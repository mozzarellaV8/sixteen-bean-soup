This path leads to Edible Dry Beans by bean class and attributes.

There are varying attributes per bean class, but four bedrock measurements that appear across classes are

- acres harvested
- acres planted
- production, measured in CWT
- yield, measured in lb/acre

Depending on the type of bean, data by year will date back to as early as the 1900s or as recently as the 2000s. Could this mean that certain beans were not produced until only recently? Or could it mean that certain beans were not accounted for until only recently? 

Two types of beans ceased to be measured in the mid 1960s - **White Marrow** and **Yelloweye**.
