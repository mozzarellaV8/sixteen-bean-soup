Pinto Beans (_phaseolus vulgaris_)

- [Edible Dry Bean Data](sixteen-bean-data)

## to do

- ~~arrange and count beans~~
- find ~~way~~ better way to arrange and count more beans
- cross-ref USDA, ACS/Census data

The first count, before building a crude wooden matrix to sort beans. Distribution naturally appeared Gaussian, rather deceptively.
