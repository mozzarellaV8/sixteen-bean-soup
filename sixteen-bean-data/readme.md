This path leads to Edible Dry Beans by bean class and attributes.

There are varying attributes per bean class, but four bedrock measurements that appear across classes are

- acres harvested
- acres planted
- production, measured in CWT
- yield, measured in lb/acre

Depending on the type of bean, data by year will date back to as early as the 1900s or as recently as the 2000s. Could this mean that certain beans were not produced until only recently? 

Two types of beans ceased to be measured in the mid 1960s - Marrow White Beans and Yelloweye.

This data comes in the form of outdated Lotus _.wk1_ files...

But luckily there are also 62 tables in .xls format.

The first 19 tables contain edible dry bean data by state from 1900s-2010, covering: 

- planted area, in 1000s of acres
- harvested area, in 1000s of acres
- yield, in pounds
- production, in 1000s of cwt
- price, in $/cwt
- value, in 1000s of dollars

Tables 20-40: Dry bean production by class, and again by state and year. Examples of commercial class include:

- Great Northern
- Kidney
- Navy
- Other
- Pinto

Depending on the state, more or less bean classes are recorded.
